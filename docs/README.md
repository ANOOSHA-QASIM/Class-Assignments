# Hunar Hub - AI-Powered Skill Marketplace

## 🌟 Overview

**Hunar Hub** is a Streamlit-based web application developed for **Class 07 Assignment - One Dollar Challenge**. It serves as a skill-sharing marketplace where sellers can list services across categories like:

- Mehndi Design 🎨 (e.g., Bridal, Party)
- Stitching & Tailoring 🧵
- Handmade Crafts 🧶
- Cooking & Baking 🍰
- Teaching & Tutoring 📚

Buyers can browse, book with payment, and rate these services. The app uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Python, Streamlit, and a rule-based AI recommendation system to suggest services based on user interests.
